\section{Running the Code}

Ideally, you will just need to download and install \href{https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual}{Anaconda} and a couple of other Python packages.  

To check if the Python executable is in your path and that it is Python 3\texttt{+}, run the command \verb|python --version| 
inside your terminal emulator. If it succeeds in printing something similar to ``\verb|Python 3.7.3|'' --- as it did on my laptop --- then 
you have successfully installed the Anaconda distro. 

The additional packages required can be installed executing in succession the following commands:
\begin{quote}
\color{blue}
\texttt{pip install colorama}  \footnote{If you don't have superuser access during installation, add the flag \texttt{\color{red} \texttt{-{}-}user}}  \\
\texttt{pip install tsp} \\
\texttt{git clone https://github.com/jvkersch/pyconcorde} \\
\texttt{cd pyconcorde}\\
\texttt{pip install -e .}
\end{quote}


To run the code, \texttt{cd} into the code's top-level folder, then type any one of the following commands into your terminal. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|python src/main.py --interactive|
\item \verb|python src/main.py --batchtest|
\item \verb|python src/main.py --file <points.yaml>|
\end{itemize}

Please note, while  running the  code in `\verb|interactive|` mode you will a
warning message:


\begin{quote}

\color{blue}
\verb|CoreApplication::exec: The event loop is already running|
\end{quote}

Please ignore it! It doesn't affect any of the results. Something in the
the internals of the Matplotlib that uses the Qt library triggers that warning. I 
am not sure what. The message doesn't pop up
when I use Python 2.7 \footnote{Note that Python 2 has been deprecated in favour of Python 3\texttt{+}, since January 2020, } 
instead of Python 3.7. 

If you have any trouble --- or detect a bug! ---  we can hash things out on Slack, Github or email.
